# todo-list

A todo list web app with local storage made for an odin project assignment ~

Live Link:- https://zo-snow.github.io/todo-list/

My insights:- 

The sample todo lists provided had a functionality of adding a task from the home page, and it would be displayed in the corresponding section for example "Today's List" if it had todays date. 

The layout consisted of all the lists displayed on the left side along with the projects names in a bar with the list items displaying on the right side whenever selecting a list.

I personally found this a slightly more cluttered way and decided to make a todo lists page which is neat and 
has seperate sections, with a clear home page, navbars to navigate to projects section and todo lists section.

The projects section consists of the project names in a clear, easy to understand and accesible way, opening the projcects on click and thus displaying its tasks.

The todo lists section has two lists and displays the corresponding tasks of the opened list upon clicking them.

This way everything remains seperate and clear and everything stays in its own sections.

Tho further functionality may be added later to view alllll the tasks in a section "All tasks" provided in the 
home section where you can view all tasks and see which list do they come from.

Further the "All tasks" section can have sub sections of lists named "Completed", "Pending" and "All".

Plus note:-  

I might add some more neat features later such as a cancel button when deciding to add a new task
or a project, making the date display in the tasks and today's list's heading more beautifully in a nice format like "Tuesday, Feb 6 2024" and more c:
